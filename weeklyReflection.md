# Weekly Reflection

Document how your week in Ent Java went. You may use whatever format suits you, as long as you share how much time you worked and provide a general overview of how things went: achievements and struggles.


### Week 1
First week of classes, just getting my bearings 
Mostly worked weekly course material, getting familiar again with servlets and JSPs
*Did have a slight issue with my port number, but switching it to 8088 (instead of 8080), seemed to work 
### Week 2
Good review of JSTL, JSP, and Beans, etc. Also, working again with DB connection
Again, mostly week course material

### Week 3
Finished the weekly work - junit and log4j
Enjoyed doing the Advent of Code puzzle!
### Week 4
Really struggled with this week's weekly material, probably spent more time on it than anything else this week.
Also realized, that I am falling behind on the project

### Week 5
This week was cool, but also a struggle. It took awhile for me to work through the example videos; 
however, it paid off a bit with working on the week assignment
Main learning points were
* Getting more familiar with working with DBs on IntelliJ
* Using a genericDao for testing
* Actually getting a one-to-many relationship to work in a web app scenario (not just in SQL)
